Tony,

Here are the names for the chassis in the back and their blades.  They are reachable from soho:

Chassis CMCs:
cmcmercer14.es.its.nyu.edu ... cmcmercer23.es.its.nyu.edu

Blade iDRACs:
spmercer-14-0.es.its.nyu.edu ... spmercer-23-15.es.its.nyu.edu

Blade OS ethernet:
compute-14-0.local ... compute-23-15.local

Blade OS IB:
compute-14-0-ib.ibnet ... compute-23-15-ib.ibnet

I have shutdown the blades at the OS level.  Please check with hpc-staff before doing anything at the chassis level.  If you plan to shutdown the whole chassis, also let eSys know ahead of time to stop monitoring cmcmercer14.es.its.nyu.edu ... cmcmercer23.es.its.nyu.edu.

Thanks,

Eric
