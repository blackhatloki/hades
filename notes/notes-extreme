Not sure why you haven't gotten a response, but here goes:

Connect to the Switch via the console port.
Power the switch on.
When it says "Press and hold the <spacebar> to enter the bootrom" hold the spacebar.
You should shortly get to a "BootRom>" prompt.
Type "config none" and press enter.
Type "boot" and press enter.

This should allow you to login with the default username, "admin" and no password, it will probably go through the automatic setup when you log in.

Hi Ensomis,

Thanks for responding but I'm afraid your suggestion did not work. When I entered "config none" I receive the following:
BootStrap > config none
config: Command not found. Try 'h' for help!

BootStrap > unconfigure switch all
unconfigure: Command not found. Try 'h' for help!

I have also tried:

and
http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=376981

But these did not work either. I get the following when I hit "d":
BootStrap > d
d: not enough arguments
usage: d [-bhwdsrx] adr [cnt]

I even tried:
BootStrap > d f
Error when reading memory!

Not sure where I am going wrong.
