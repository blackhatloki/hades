Booting into a live CD is a great way to fix problems on a broken machine. But what if you need to do more than just edit a file or two. 
Many times when you are fixing a machine, you need to chroot into it. Many of those times the programs you run (such as grub-install) will need the /proc, /dev, and /sys directories to be alive and well. This is when you need to use bind.

For this example, we will try to run "grub-install" to try to fix a machine who's grub didn't install properly. 
You might notice, that when we bind /proc, /dev, and /sys, they do not show up when you do a "df". To see them you have to do a "mount" command.

# mount /dev/hda5 /mnt/hda5
# chroot /mnt/hda5/
[chroot]# grub-install /dev/hda
/dev/hda: Not found or not a block device.
[chroot]# exit
exit
# mount -o bind /proc /mnt/hda5/proc/
# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/hda5/dev/
# mount -o bind /sys /mnt/hda5/sys
# df -h
