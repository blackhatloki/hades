<!-- Description:  This is a sample XML script to power cycle (off   -->
<!--               and then back on) the host server in which the    -->
<!--               following device is operating:                   -->
<!--                 Integrated Lights-Out 2 (iLO 2)                 -->

<!--        This script will NOT attempt to gracefully shutdown the  -->
<!--        host operating system before it powers off the server.   -->

<!--        If graceful shutdown is needed (if your OS supports it), -->
<!--        then use the Set_Host_Power_Off.xml script to attempt a  -->
<!--        graceful shutdown of the OS (if your OS supports it)     -->
<!--        before powering off the server and then use the          -->
<!--        Set_Host_Power_On.xml script to turn the server back on. -->


<!--        Use CPQLOCFG.EXE ver 2.25 or greater with this script.   -->
