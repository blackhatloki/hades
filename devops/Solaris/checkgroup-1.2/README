       checkgroup: Lists groups for each user ...

checkgroup is a quick-n-dirty tool that parses the UNIX group file and
outputs which groups each user belongs to. This was written because we
had people in more than 16 groups and this chokes NIS ... so (radical idea! ;-),
we wanted to keep an eye on this before it became an issue. You can sort the
output by user or usage ... and optionally only show those folks who 
belong to more than ## groups. It also does these checks:

- Check the password file for any duplicate usernames and UIDs.
- Flag any users listed in the group file that are NOT listed
  in the password file.
- Flag any groups that have no usernames and are not referenced 
  in the password file

You'll need to edit the checknetgroup Perl script to reflect the location
of Perl on your machine. You may also want to tweek a few things that are
noted at the top of the file. 


Pls send me any suggestions and/or comments.
