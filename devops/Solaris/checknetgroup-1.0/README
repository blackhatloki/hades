       checknetgroup: Check netgroup file for various oddities 

checknetgroup is a quick-n-dirty tool that parses the UNIX netgroup file and
looks for various oddities - specifically: 
    1. If a netgroup key has NO values
    2. If a netgroup key is repeated
    3. If a netgroup value (member) is "orphaned"
    4. If the hostname value looks suspicious or does not exist
    5. If the username value looks suspicious or does not exist
    6. If a netgroup includes itself as a member
    7. If a netgroup includes a member which is allready rolled up - i.e. 
          netkey1 member1
          netkey2 netkey1 member1
    8. If a netgroup has a circular reference - i.e.
          netkey2 netkey1
          netkey3 netkey2
          netkey1 netkey3
       Note: Items from #6 above should/will probably show up here also

You'll need to edit the checknetgroup Perl script to reflect the location
of Perl on your machine. You may also want to tweek a few things that are
noted at the top of the file. 


Pls send me any suggestions and/or comments.
